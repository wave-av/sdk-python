# WAVE public-repo BODY policy — the internal-leak gate for PR/issue/comment text.
#
# Companion to content-policy.sh. That script scans the published working TREE;
# this one scans the other half of a public repo's surface: pull-request titles
# and bodies, issue bodies, and comment bodies. Those are equally world-readable
# and, until this script existed, were scanned by NOTHING server-side. That gap
# was not theoretical — a PR was merged whose wrangler.toml was correctly BLOCKED
# for naming a private repo while the PR body named the same repo, with more
# operational detail attached, and sailed through.
#
# Usage: scripts/public-repo-guard/body-policy.sh <file>
#   <file> holds the untrusted text, already materialized to disk. It is passed as
#   a PATH and only ever read — the body is never interpolated into a command line
#   or an environment variable, so no amount of shell metacharacters in a PR body
#   can influence what runs here.
#
# Exit: 0 clean · 1 blocking violation · 2 scanner error (fail closed).
#
# Allowlisting: a line carrying `guard:allow <reason>` is exempt (an accidental
# leak never carries the marker; a deliberate one is visible in a public diff).
# Prose-shaped rules (tagged `prose` below) are additionally exempt on lines
# matching the ABOUT-THE-CONTROL allowlist; credential and infrastructure rules
# are NOT — a real key is a leak no matter what else shares its line.

# summary quoted the phrase verbatim. The line-level allowlist could not help —
# that line named no gate. Only use-vs-mention separates the two.
#
# A quoted marker is also a trivial bypass, and that is an accepted trade. The
# threat here is the ACCIDENTAL paste; a deliberate evader has easier routes, and
# `guard:allow <reason>` already exists as the honest, visible one.
#
# Case-insensitivity is scoped per-rule with (?i:...), never a leading (?i): a

# --- Private repo + operational detail (PROXIMITY, not bare name) ------------
# The BODY profile deliberately DIVERGES from the FILE profile here, and the
# divergence is the whole design. content-policy.sh blocks a bare private-repo
# name outright, which is right for a checked-in file. Applying that to bodies
# would be unusable: a sweep of public issues found 134 LEGITIMATE cross-repo
# references ("companion to <private-repo>#260"). A gate that fires on all of
# those gets switched off, and then it protects nothing.
#
# So a bare mention stays silent. What fires is a private repo name and INTERNAL
# OPERATIONAL DETAIL on the SAME LINE, within ~140 characters of each other — a
# SCREAMING_CASE credential NAME, a secret-binding verb, a service binding, or a
# secret COUNT. That is the topology of what is wired to what, and it is the
# shape that actually leaked. Trade accepted: the scan is line-scoped (rg matches
# per line and the separator excludes newlines), so a repo name on one line and
# the detail on the next does not fire. Cross-line proximity would need multiline
# scanning with its own false-positive budget; revisit if that shape leaks.
